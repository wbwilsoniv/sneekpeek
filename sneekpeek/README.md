# SneekPeek
SneekPeek is an app where users can track upcoming sneaker releases. They have full CRUD capabilities with whatever sneakers they’ve created and can also add new podcasts and reviews. 



## Motivation

As a long-time sneaker afficionado, I wanted to create an app where I can keep track of upcoming sneaker release dates  

## General Approach

For this project, we decided that starting out with a basic ERD would be the easiest way to approach it. After drawing out an ERD and stating the relationships between the two tables, we broke our app into two components: An app directory with files to control the back-end and a client directory with files to control the front end. For our backend, we set up a seed file and schema file, where we hard-coded data into to build our database for testing. 

From there we set about building up the app where we would define our models, controllers and routes for CRUD on both podcasts and reviews.

For the client side, which will be our front-end we used create-react-app to create our Pass The Podcorn app. 

After creating both a functional front-end and back-end, we used CSS and Bulma to style and format our app.
