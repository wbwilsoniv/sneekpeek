# SneekPeek
SneekPeek is an app where users can track upcoming sneaker releases. They have full CRUD capabilities with whatever sneakers they’ve created and can also add new podcasts and reviews. 



## Motivation

As a long-time sneaker afficionado, I wanted to create an app where I can keep track of upcoming sneaker release dates  

## General Approach


For this project I started with creating ERDs for Sneakers and Brands. The back-end was then built using Ruby on Rails.

From there we set about building up the app where we would define our models, controllers and routes for CRUD on both podcasts and reviews.

For the client side,  the front-end I used react.js. 

After creating both a functional front-end and back-end, I used CSS and Bulma to style and format our app.
